## Data Preparation

During the Data Preparation phase, the primary goal was to convert the raw dataset into a clean and organized format that is appropriate for modeling. This stage is essential for guaranteeing the precision and dependability of the predictive model. Below is a comprehensive summary of the actions undertaken:

- **Data Cleaning:**
    - **Addressing Missing Values:** Identified the presence of missing values in several columns, including year, manufacturer, model, condition, cylinders, fuel type, odometer readings, title status, transmission type, drive type, size category, car type, paint color, and state.

    - **Managing Outliers:** Outliers were dealt with by either removing them, applying transformations (such as log transformation), or capping extreme values. Specifically, outliers in the year, odometer, and price columns were eliminated using the IQR method.

    - **Eliminating Duplicates:** All duplicate entries were removed from the dataset.

    - **Correcting Data Types:** No adjustments were necessary for data types.

    - **Resolving Inconsistencies:** There were no issues related to inconsistent data (e.g., negative values for age).

    - **Splitting Data into Training and Test Sets:** This step involved dividing the dataset to ensure that a portion of it could be used for training the model while the remainder would be utilized for testing its performance. Conducting a train/test split before feature engineering and modeling is critical to prevent data leakage and to provide an accurate assessment of the modelâ€™s effectiveness on unseen data.

- **Prevention of Data Leakage**
    - **Accurate Evaluation**
    - **Ethical Modeling Practices**

- **Feature Engineering / Data Transformation:**
    - **Normalization/Scaling:** Numerical features like price, vehicle age, and odometer readings underwent scaling using methods such as Min-Max scaling to standardize their range, thereby enhancing the performance of machine learning algorithms sensitive to differing scales.

    - **Polynomial Features:** The numerical features of price, vehicle age, and odometer were modified using polynomial feature generation with a degree of 2.

    - **Encoding Categorical Variables:**

        - **Target Encoding:** The make_model variable was encoded through target encoding.
        - **One-Hot Encoding:** Variables such as fuel, transmission, type, and paint color were transformed into numerical format using one-hot encoding.
        - **Ordinal Encoding:** The condition, cylinders, title status, drive type, and size were encoded using ordinal encoding.
    - **Deriving New Features:** New features were created or adjusted from existing ones to improve predictive capabilities. For instance, a derived feature labeled "vehicle age" was created by calculating the difference between the current year and the year of manufacture, providing valuable insights into pricing trends related to depreciation. Additionally, a make_model feature was generated by combining the manufacturer and model columns.

By thoroughly preparing the dataset in this manner, a robust foundation was established for the development and assessment of predictive models aimed at accurately estimating used car prices. This phase not only improved the quality of the data but also facilitated the subsequent stages of modeling, evaluation, and deployment within the CRISP-DM framework. 

## Modeling
During the Modeling phase, the objective was to build a reliable predictive model capable of estimating used car prices based on the refined dataset. The key steps and considerations were as follows:

- **Model Selection:** Several regression models were assessed, including Linear, Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net Regression, all chosen for their suitability in predicting continuous variables. These models were evaluated based on their ability to accommodate the dataset's structure, provide interpretability, and deliver high predictive accuracy.

- **Model Training:** The chosen models were trained using the dataset curated during the data preparation stage. Techniques such as grid search and cross-validation were employed to fine-tune model parameters, enhancing performance and mitigating the risk of overfitting.

### Modeling Output
Among the four models, ElasticNet Regression delivers the best performance, demonstrating the lowest RMSE and also has the highest RÂ² score, making it the most appropriate model for this dataset based on these metrics. Both Ridge and Lasso yielded comparable results, suggesting further evaluation with varying alpha values could be beneficial.

**RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)** = 9589.6535: This metric reflects the average prediction error. In this case, the model's predictions deviate by approximately 9589.6535 units from the actual car prices, on average.

**RÂ² (R-squared)** = 0: Elastic Net also has the highest RÂ² value (-0.0000), which is closer to zero than the other models. Although all RÂ² values are negative, indicating that none of the models perform well in explaining the variance of the target variable, Elastic Net still performs slightly better.

## Evaluation
In the Evaluation phase, the trained models were assessed to verify that they aligned with project goals and business requirements:

**Evaluation Metrics:** Metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) were used to evaluate the prediction accuracy. These metrics helped gauge how closely the models' predicted used car prices matched the actual values.

**Model Validation:** The models were validated on the test dataset, reserved during data preparation, to ensure they generalized well to new, unseen data and were not overfitting to the training data.

**VIF for Multicollinearity:** Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) was calculated to detect multicollinearity among the independent variables. VIF quantifies how much the variance of a regression coefficient increases due to collinearity with other features. A VIF above 10 typically signals high multicollinearity, although even lower values can pose issues depending on the model and context.

  - **Interpretation of VIF Results**
The VIF analysis indicates that several features exhibit infinite (inf) values, pointing to perfect multicollinearity. This occurs when certain features are exact linear combinations of others, making it impossible to estimate their coefficients independently.

**Features with Infinite VIF:**

- **Paint Colors:** All categories for paint color show infinite VIF, indicating perfect collinearity.
- **Vehicle Types:** Categories such as mini-van, hatchback, coupe, etc., have infinite VIF values, signifying perfect multicollinearity.
- **Fuel Types:** Every fuel type category also displays infinite VIF.
- **Transmission Types:** Transmission types exhibit infinite VIF, indicating they are fully collinear with other features.

- **Cross Validation and Hyperparameter Tuning** was performed to evaluate the models.

    - Best Elastic Net Regression: {'alpha': 10.0}, RMSE = 9575.2535
    - Best Ridge: {'alpha': 100.0}, RMSE = 9575.5213
    - Best Lasso: {'alpha': 10.0}, RMSE = 9575.2680

    - Evaluate the best models on the test set
        - Elastic Net Regression: RMSE = 9589.5822, R2 = 0.0000
        - Ridge: RMSE = 9591.3010, R2 = -0.0003
        - Lasso: RMSE = 9589.7797, R2 = -0.0000

## Model Predictions

- **Best Model: ElasticNet with cross-validation**
    - Mean cross-validation score: -0.00013489488781877058
    - Standard deviation of cross-validation score: 0.00016909724467853622
    
- **Permutation Inportance** was used to assess the importance of the coefficients. It didn't make any difference in the performance of the model after removing negative permutation importance coefficients.
    - Elastic Net Regression: RMSE = 9589.5467, R2 = 0.0000
    - Ridge: RMSE = 9589.7044, R2 = -0.0000
    - Lasso: RMSE = 9589.6899, R2 = -0.0000
